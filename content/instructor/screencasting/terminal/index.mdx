If you will be showing your command line, we suggest using a minimal prompt to reduce distractions. This example prompt works well for screencasting:

You can use this one by updating your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` with the following:

```bash
export PS1="\n\[\e[32m\]\W\n\[\e[m\]\[\e[34m\]\\$\[\e[m\]"
```

Note: If youâ€™re on Mac and using Bash, you also need to add a `~/.bash_profile` with this:

`source $HOME/.bashrc`

This tells Mac to load your `~/.bashrc` when loading a terminal emulator.
