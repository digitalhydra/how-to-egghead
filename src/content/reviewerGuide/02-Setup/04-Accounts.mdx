## Accounts

### Github
Your Github account is what you'll use to create accounts with all the other required services.

Sign up here ðŸ‘‰ [github.com](https://github.com/)

Once you have an account created contact a Content Team Lead and they will provide you with the invitations to egghead.io's Github organizations.
